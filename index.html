				<h2>2020: A New Beginning</h2>
				<p>
					The year when COVID-19 had a profound impact on the world, leaving
					many with <strong>extra time</strong> on their hands.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was during this time that I decided to embark on a journey of
					<strong>learning something new</strong> and discovered
					<strong>SheCodes</strong>.

				<h2>2021: The Coding Adventure Begins</h2>
				<p>
					In February, I successfully
					<strong>completed two workshops</strong> and earned my
					<strong>first certificates</strong>, marking the beginning of my
					coding adventure.
				</p>
				<p>
					In May, life and work took a toll on me, leading to burnout: it was
					<strong>time to reevaluate my path</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following this challenging period, I embarked on a
					<strong>soul-searching journey</strong> to determine what changes I
					needed in my life to find fulfillment.

				<h2>2022: A Bold Move</h2>
				<p>
					In a bold move, I decided to
					<strong>resign from my job</strong> (project manager in a
					communication agency), setting my sights on a transition into the
					world of <strong>web development as a freelancer</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite having made the decision to quit, I found myself in a
					situation where I had to continue working for six more months. This
					was a really <strong>rough period</strong> that eventually led to a
					second bout of burnout and health issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consequently, by the end of 2022, I was more determined than ever to
					<strong>prioritize my well-being</strong> and fully commit to my
					<strong>transition into the world of coding</strong>.

				<h2>2023: Business and Growth</h2>
				<p>
					I persevered and completed my remaining SheCodes workshops, determined
					to <strong>further advance my coding skill</strong>, especially in
					JavaScript and in <strong>learning React</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>In July, I created my own business as a self-employed developer.</p>
				<p>
					Since then, I've been on a non-stop mission to
					<strong>level up my skills</strong>, putting my heart into
					<strong>personal projects</strong>, working on my confidence, and
					diving into <strong>the ever-changing world of coding</strong>.
